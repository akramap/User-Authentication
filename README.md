# Project

## Requirements

Recommended editor:
Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Prerequisite knowledge:
VS Code, Docker, JOI, ESLint, ES6, Mysql, Sequelize

System requirements:

- NODE Version : 8.9.0
- NPM Version : 5.5.0
- Docker: 18.09

## Getting Started

Make a copy of production.json as development.json in src/config folder and edit it as required
```sh
cp src/config/production.json src/config/development.json 
```
Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Set environment (vars):

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```


Run dependent services (mysql, redis) in docker container
```sh
docker-compose up;
```

Create db and Run migrations and seeds if needed
```sh
# To create db
npm run sequelize db:create;

# To run the migrations
npm run sequelize db:migrate; 

# To insert the seeds
npm run sequelize db:seed:all;
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run sequelize` - for using sequelize-cli
- `npm start` - for starting development server
- `npm run startD` - for starting development server with nodemon
- `npm run build:start` - for packaging production build - it will build and start production enviroment
- `npm run start:prod` - for starting production server with existing build

##### Deployment

```sh
# compile to ES5
npm run build:start

# upload dist/ to your server
scp -rp dist/ user@dest:/path

# install production dependencies only
npm install --production

# Use any process manager to start your services
pm2 start dist/index.js
```

##### Deployment with docker

```sh
# preparing docker build
docker build -f Dockerfile  -t  <registry-path>/<image-name>:<version> .

# pushing docker build to registry
docker push <registry-path>/<image-name>:<version>

# Copy environment specific docker-compose.production.yml file
scp <ProjectPath>/docker-compose.production.yml user@dest:docker-compose.yml

# In production server run following
docker pull <registry-path>/<image-name>:<version> && docker-compose down && docker-compose up;
```

## Docker

#### Using Docker Compose for Development

```sh
# service restarts on file change
bash bin/development.sh
```

#### Building and running without Docker Compose

```bash
# To use this option you need to make sure mysql is listening on port 3306

# Build docker
docker build -t projectPath .

# Run docker
docker run -p 4040:4040 projectPath
```
